# Get Involved

OpenTracing needs your help to proliferate. Weâ€™ve already had contributors instrument OSS projects, build tracing systems, and work on the API. If you are interested in getting involved, please drop us a note at [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opentracing) or say hello on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/opentracing/public) and we will work with you to come up with a useful proposal.

You can get involved by:

- [Joining OT-contrib](./contrib)
- [Joining a working group](./working-group)
- [Creating an RFC](./rfc)
- [Registering your project](./register)
