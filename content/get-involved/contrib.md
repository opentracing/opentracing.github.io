# Join OpenTracing-Contrib

OpenTracing-Contrib contains several OpenTracing instrumentation projects developed by contributors. Repositories under [github.com/opentracing-contrib](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib) pertain to specific open-source software packages and projects. Each may have its own owners and internal policies regarding PRs, review requirements, and committer management.

## How to contribute?

You can contribute by either instrumenting your own project with OpenTracing or contributing to the existing projects in the repository. You can learn more about OpenTracing contributions via the [opentracing-contrib meta-repository](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/meta).
