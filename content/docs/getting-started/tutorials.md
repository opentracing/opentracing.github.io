## Katacoda Courses

Katacoda is an  interactive learning and training platform for software developers.  It allows you to learn and explore new technologies using hands-on labs in your browser, using real environments, without any downloads or configuration.

The OpenTracing community has started creating [OpenTracing courses on Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/opentracing) so that developers can evaluate the technology and see how distributed tracing can be used to observe a microservice application.

We also welcome contributions of additional OpenTracing Katacoda scenarios.  You can find our Katacoda scenario source on [GitHub](https://github.com/katacoda-scenarios/opentracing-scenarios).  Visit the [Katacoda docs](https://www.katacoda.com/docs) to learn more about creating Katacoda scenarios.
