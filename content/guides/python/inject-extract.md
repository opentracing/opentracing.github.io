title: "Python: Inject and Extract"

## Introduction

In order to trace across process boundaries and RPC calls in distributed systems, `spanContext` needs to propagated over the wire. The OpenTracing Python API provides two functions in the Tracer interface to do just that, `inject(SpanContext, format, carrier)` and `extract(format, carrier)`.

## Format Options and Carriers
The **format** parameter refers to one of the three standard encodings the OpenTracing API defines:

1. `TEXT_MAP` where `spanContext` is encoded as a collection of string key-value pairs,
2. `BINARY` where `spanContext` is encoded as an opaque byte array,
3. `HTTP_HEADERS`, which is similar to `TEXT_MAP` except that the keys must be safe to be used as HTTP headers.

The **carrier** is an abstraction over the underlying RPC framework. For example, a carrier for `TEXT_MAP` format is a dictionary, while a carrier for `BINARY` format is a `bytearray`.

## Injecting and Extracting HTTP
When your service calls a downstream service, it's useful to pass down the `SpanContext`, so that `Spans` generated by this service could join the Spans from our service in a single trace. To do that, our service needs to `Inject` the `SpanContext` into the payload. On the other side of the connection, the downstream service needs then to `Extract` the `SpanContext` before it creates any `Spans`.

#### Injecting the `spanContext` to HTTP
In order to pass a `spanContext` over the HTTP request, the developer needs to call the `tracer.inject` before building the HTTP request, like so:

```python
from opentracing.ext import tags
from opentracing.propagation import Format

def http_get(port, path, param, value):
    url = 'http://localhost:%s/%s' % (port, path)

    span = get_current_span()
    span.set_tag(tags.HTTP_METHOD, 'GET')
    span.set_tag(tags.HTTP_URL, url)
    span.set_tag(tags.SPAN_KIND, tags.SPAN_KIND_RPC_CLIENT)
    headers = {}
    tracer.inject(span, Format.HTTP_HEADERS, headers)

    r = requests.get(url, params={param: value}, headers=headers)
    assert r.status_code == 200
    return r.text

```
Notice that a couple additional tags have been added to the `span` with some metadata about the HTTP request, following the [OpenTracing Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/semantic_conventions.md).

#### Extracting the Span’s Context from Incoming Request

The logic on the client side instrumentation is similar, the only difference is that `tracer.extract` is used and the `span` is tagged as `span.kind=server`.

```python
@app.route("/format")
def format():
    span_ctx = tracer.extract(Format.HTTP_HEADERS, request.headers)
    span_tags = {tags.SPAN_KIND: tags.SPAN_KIND_RPC_SERVER}
    with tracer.start_span('format', child_of=span_ctx, tags=span_tags):
        hello_to = request.args.get('helloTo')
        return 'Hello, %s!' % hello_to

```

## Injecting and Extracting TextMap
The process of injecting and extracting `TextMap` is similar to that of HTTP. Given below are some elaborated code examples of [injecting](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/blob/master/tests/test_noop_tracer.py) and [extracting](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/blob/master/tests/test_noop_tracer.py) tracing information using `TextMap` format.

```python
def test_new_trace():
    tracer = Tracer()

    span = tracer.start_span(operation_name='test')
    span.set_baggage_item('Fry', 'Leela')
    span.set_tag('x', 'y')
    span.log_event('z')

    child = tracer.start_span(operation_name='child',
                              references=opentracing.child_of(span.context))
    child.log_event('w')
    carrier = {}
    tracer.inject(
        span_context=child.context, format=Format.TEXT_MAP, carrier=carrier)
    child.finish()
    span.finish()
```
The above function injects the child span’s `spanContext` into `TEXT_MAP` carrier.

```python

def test_join_trace():
   tracer = Tracer()
   span_ctx = tracer.extract(format=Format.TEXT_MAP, carrier={})
   span = tracer.start_span(operation_name='test',
                            references=opentracing.child_of(span_ctx))
   span.set_tag('x', 'y')
   span.set_baggage_item('a', 'b')
   span.log_event('z')
   span.finish()

}
```
Here, `tracer.extract()` is used to extract the `spanContext` from the carrier and start a new `Span` with `operation_name = ‘test’`. The logic is the reverse operation of the `tracer.inject()`.

## Injecting and Extracting BINARY
`BINARY` format is used for injecting/extracting `spanContext` encoded in an opaque byte array. Opaque means that the inner representation of the array is not known.

Injecting and extracting `BINARY` can be implemented as follows:

```python
#Inject binary
def inject_trace():
    tracer = Tracer()
    span = tracer.start_span()

    bin_carrier = bytearray()
    tracer.inject(
        span_context=span.context,
        format=Format.BINARY,
        carrier=bin_carrier)
```

```python
#Extract binary
def extract_trace():
    tracer = Tracer()
    noop_span = tracer._noop_span

    bin_carrier = bytearray()
    span_ctx = tracer.extract(Format.BINARY, carrier=bin_carrier)

```

Code example coming soon.
