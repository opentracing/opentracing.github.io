### Tracer Interface

The Python `Tracer` interface creates `Spans` and understands how to `Inject` (serialize) and `Extract` (deserialize) their metadata across process boundaries. It has the following capabilities:

- Start a new `Span`
- `Inject` a `SpanContext` into a carrier
- `Extract` a `SpanContext` from a carrier

Each of these will be discussed in more detail below.

### Setting up a Tracer

A `Tracer` is the actual implementation that will record the `Spans` and publish them somewhere. Python `Tracer` implementation defines both the public Tracer API and provides a default no-op behavior.
Different `Tracer` implementations vary in how and what parameters they receive at initialization time, such as:

- Component name for this application's traces.
- Tracing endpoint.
- Tracing credentials.
- Sampling strategy.

For example, initializing the `Tracer` implementation of Jaeger might look like this:

```python
import logging
from jaeger_client import Config

def init_tracer(service):
    logging.getLogger('').handlers = []
    logging.basicConfig(format='%(message)s', level=logging.DEBUG)

    config = Config(
        config={
            'sampler': {
                'type': 'const',
                'param': 1,
            },
            'logging': True,
        },
        service_name=service,
    )

    # this call also sets opentracing.tracer
    return config.initialize_tracer()
```

To use this instance, replace `opentracing.tracer` with `init_tracer(...)`, like so:

`tracer = init_tracer('hello-world')`

### Starting a new Trace
The `Tracer` instance obtained can be used to manually create `Span` that will start a new trace. This can be done in two ways:

1. `Tracer.start_active_span()` creates a new `Span` and automatically activates it.

2. `Tracer.start_span()` creates a new `Span`

`Tracer.start_span()` and `Tracer.start_active_span()` will automatically use the current active `Span` as a parent, unless the programmer passes a specified parent context or sets `ignore_active_span=True`.

A new `trace` can be started like so:

```Python

# Manual activation of the Span.
span = tracer.start_span(operation_name='someWork')
with tracer.scope_manager.activate(span, True) as scope:
    # Do things.

# Automatic activation of the Span.
# finish_on_close is a required parameter.
with tracer.start_active_span('someWork', finish_on_close=True) as scope:
    # Do things.

```

### Accessing the Active Span
For getting/setting the current active `Span` in the used request-local storage, OpenTracing requires that every `Tracer` contains a `ScopeManager` that grants access to the active `Span` through a `Scope`. Any `Span` may be transferred to another task or thread, but not `Scope`. This is implemented as follows:

```Python
# Access to the active span is straightforward.
scope = tracer.scope_manager.active()
if scope is not None:
    scope.span.set_tag('...', '...')
```

### Propagating a Trace with Inject/Extract
In order to trace across process boundaries in distributed systems, services need to be able to continue the trace injected by the client that sent each request. OpenTracing allows this to happen by providing inject and extract methods that encode a span's context into a carrier.
The `inject` method allows for the `SpanContext` to be passed on to a carrier. The `extract` method does the exact opposite. It extracts the `SpanContext` from the carrier.

Implemented examples of inject/extract and details can be found [here](./inject-extract).
