## What is Opentracing?

OpenTracing is a vendor-neutral open standard for distributed tracing. It offers consistent, expressive, vendor-neutral APIs for popular platforms and makes it easy for developers to add (or switch) tracing implementations with an O(1) configuration change. OpenTracing also offers a lingua franca for OSS instrumentation and platform-specific tracing helper libraries. Please refer to the Semantic Specification.

## Why does OpenTracing stand out?

Contemporary distributed tracing systems (e.g., Zipkin, Dapper, HTrace, X-Trace, among others) aim to address these issues, but they do so via application-level instrumentation using incompatible APIs. Developers are uneasy about tightly coupling their polyglot systems to any particular distributed tracing implementation, yet the application-level instrumentation APIs for these many distinct tracing systems have remarkably similar semantics.
