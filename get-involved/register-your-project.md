# OpenTracing Contributions

## New contributions

OpenTracing needs your help to proliferate. Weâ€™ve already had contributors instrument OSS projects, build tracing systems, and work on the API. If you are interested in getting involved, please drop us a note at [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opentracing) or say hello on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/opentracing/public) and we will work with you to come up with a useful proposal.

### Starting guides
We have prepared for you step by step guides which should help you to start contributing:
 * [java](/guides/java/contributions.md)

## Existing contributions

Many (but not all) contributed OpenTracing instrumentation can be found under the [the OpenTracing-contrib github organization](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib).

Other contributions are included directly/implicitly in the codebase being instrumented, or sometimes in a contrib or ecosystem for said instrumented project.

# Badges

Once you add OpenTracing support for an open-source project, please include an appropriate OpenTracing badge in said project's README.md, website, or similar.

You may either use...

Badge Flavor | Markdown Snippet | Demo

1. Co-presenting opportunities around OpenTracing, including workshops like the ones we've run at Kubecon/OSCON/etc
2. Advice if you have spoken at these events or are involved with the committee
3. Suggestions for any other events we should apply to speak at:

We are particularly interested in the following events:

- OSCON
