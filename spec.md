## Traces

A **Trace** represents the potentially distributed, potentially concurrent data/execution path in a (potentially distributed, potentially concurrent) system. A Trace can be thought of as a tree of Spans. (See the ASCII diagrams above)

## Spans

A **Span** represents a logical unit of work in the system that has a start time and a duration. Spans may be nested and ordered to model parent-child and causal relationships. Each span has an **operation name**, a presumably human-readable string which concisely names the work done by the span (e.g., an RPC method name, a function name, or the name of a subtask within a larger computation).

### Logs

Every Span has zero or more **Logs**, each of which being a timestamped event name, optionally accompanied by a structured data payload of arbitrary size. The event name should be the stable identifier for some notable moment in the lifetime of a Span. For instance, a Span representing a browser page load might add an event for each of the Performance.timing moments.

While it is not a formal requirement, specific event names should apply to many Span instances: tracing systems can use these event names (and timestamps) to analyze Spans in the aggregate.  For more information, see the [Data Semantics Guidelines](/data-semantics).

### Tags

Every Span may also have zero or more key/value **Tags**, which do not have timestamps and simply annotate the spans.

As is the case with Logs, if certain known tag key/values are used for common application scenarios, tracers can choose to pay special attention to them. For more information, see the [Data Semantics Guidelines](/data-semantics).

## Inject and Join

Spans may be **Injected** into and **Joined** from **Carrier** objects that are used for inter-process communication (e.g., HTTP headers). In this way, Spans may propagate across process boundaries along with sufficient information to join up with the Trace in some remote process.

## Baggage

**Baggage** is a set of key/value pairs stored in a Span and propagated _in-band_ to all future children Spans: in this way, the "Baggage" travels with the trace, hence the name. Given a full-stack OpenTracing integration, Baggage enables powerful functionality by transparently propagating arbitrary application data: for example, an end-user id may be added as a Baggage item in a mobile app, propagate (via the distributed tracing machinery) into the depths of a storage system, and recovered at the bottom of the stack to identify a particularly expensive SQL query.

Baggage comes with powerful _costs_ as well; since the Baggage is propagated in-band, if it is too large or the items too numerous it may decrease system throughput or increase RPC latencies.

## Baggage vs. Span Tags

- Baggage is propagated in-band (i.e., alongside the actual application data) across process boundaries. Span Tags are not propagated since they are not inherited from parent Span to child Span.
- Span Tags are recorded out-of-band from the application data, presumably in the tracing system's storage. Implementations may choose to also record Baggage out-of-band, though that decision is not dictated by the OpenTracing specification.

Also, Baggage keys have a restricted format: implementations may wish to use them as HTTP header keys (or key suffixes), and of course HTTP headers are case insensitive. As such, Baggage keys MUST match the regular expression `(?i:[a-z0-9][-a-z0-9]*)`, and – per the `?i:` – they are case-insensitive. That is, the Baggage key must start with a letter or number, and the remaining characters must be letters, numbers, or hyphens.


# Platform-Independent API Semantics

OpenTracing supports a number of different platforms, and of course the per-platform APIs try to adhere to the idioms and conventions of their respective language and platform (i.e., they "do as the Romans do"). That said, each platform API must model a common set of semantics for the core tracing concepts described above. In this document we attempt to describe those concepts and semantics in a language- and platform-agnostic fashion.

## The `Span` Interface

The `Span` interface must have the following capabilities:

- Finish the (already-started) `Span`.  Finish should be the last call made to any span instance, and to do otherwise leads to undefined behavior. **(py: `finish`, go: `Finish`)** Some implementations may record information about active `Span`s before they are `Finish`ed (e.g., for long-lived `Span` instances), or `Finish` may never be called due to host process failure or programming errors. Implementations should clearly document the `Span` durability guarantees they provide in such cases.
- Set a key:value tag on the `Span`. The key must be a `string`, and the value must be either a `string`, a `boolean`, or a numeric type. Behavior for other value types is undefined. If multiple values are set to the same key (i.e., in multiple calls), implementation behavior is also undefined. **(py: `set_tag`, go: `SetTag`)**
- Add a new log event to the `Span`, accepting an event name `string` and an optional structured payload argument. If specified, the payload argument may be of any type and arbitrary size, though implementations are not required to retain all payload arguments (or even all parts of all payload arguments). An optional timestamp can be used to specify a past timestamp. An implementation may choose to serialize log payloads asynchronously, to avoid blocking the caller with potentially expensive computation; callers should avoid mutating log payloads after they are logged or pre-serialize log payloads. **(py: `log`, go: `Log`)**
- Set a Baggage item, represented as a simple string:string pair. Note that newly-set Baggage items are only guaranteed to propagate to *future* children of the given `Span`. See the diagram below. **(py: `set_baggage_item`, go: `SetBaggageItem`)**
- Get a Baggage item by key. **(py: `get_baggage_item`, go: `BaggageItem`)**

            [Span G] [Span H] [Span I]

## The `Tracer` Interface

The `Tracer` interface must have the following capabilities:

- Start a new `Span`. There must be a way for the caller to specify a parent `Span`, an explicit start timestamp (other than "now"), and an initial set of `Span` tags. **(py: `start_span`, go: `StartSpanWithOptions`)**
- `Inject` a `Span` instance into a "carrier" object for cross-process propagation. The type of the carrier is either determined through language reflection or an explicit [format](/propagation#format-identifiers). See the [end-to-end propagation example](/propagation#propagation-example) to make this more concrete.
- `Join` a Trace given a "carrier" object whose contents crossed a process boundary. `Join` examines the carrier and tries to extract identifying information needed by the new `Span` instance it's trying to create. `Join` also accepts an operation name for that `Span` (since it's typically not included within the carrier). Unless there's an error, `Join` returns a freshly-started `Span` which can be used in the host process like any other. (Note that some OpenTracing implementations consider the `Span`s on either side of an RPC to have the same identity, and others consider the caller to be the parent and the receiver to be the child) The type of the carrier is either determined through language reflection or an explicit [format](/propagation#format-identifiers). See the [end-to-end propagation example](/propagation#propagation-example) to make this more concrete.

Note that `Inject` and `Join` are not entirely symmetrical interfaces since `Span` injection is a fundamentally lossy process (most of the `Span`'s state is meant to be recorded out-of-band from the application's own communication path, whereas Inject-ed state is meant to be sent in-band along with the application data).


### Global and No-op Tracers

OpenTracing libraries must provide a no-op Tracer as part of their interface. The no-op Tracer implementation must not crash and should have no side-effects, including baggage propagation. The Tracer implementation must provide a no-op Span implementation as well; in this way, the instrumentation code that relies on Span instances returned by the Tracer does not need to change to accommodate the possibility of no-op implementations. The no-op Tracer's `Inject` method should always succeed, and `Join` should always return a "trace not found" status.

OpenTracing implementations should provide support for configuring (Go: `InitGlobalTracer()`, py: `opentracing.tracer = myTracer`) and retrieving (Go: `GlobalTracer()`, py: `opentracing.tracer`) a global Tracer instance if this is possible from the platform perspective. The default global Tracer must be the no-op Tracer.
